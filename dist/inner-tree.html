              <p>
                “Inner Tree” is a VR experience that allows the viewer to
                explore the different stages of the process of enlightenment.
                Each person will experience it in a slightly different way.
                Hopefully, allowing the viewer to reflect on the importance of
                introspective, spiritual practices, rather than focusing solely
                on an external search for answers.

              The project has required intensive research through Kabbalistic
              and Hermetic principles as well as research into Tibetan
              meditation, Buddhism, Masonic Initiation. These was combined with
              research about Virtual Reality and technology to come up with a
              philosophical framework that was worthy of exploring as an
              artistic piece.

            <p>
              For the layout of the project, it was decided to divide the
              project into four chapters, each explaining a Sephiroth from the
              Qabalistic “Tree of Life”. Each chapter needs to have its own
              cohisive visual style and a unique script that has a philosophical
              structure that ties the whole project together.

            <br />
            <p>
              For the World Design, I created a basic layout about how each
              chapter will look like, what their main philosophical concept is
              going to be about and how they relate to the Cabalistic Tree of
              Life. Creating an infographic if how each stage of the VR
              experience is going to feel to the user.
              <br />
              During the whole experience, the player will be hearing a voice
              that guides him/her. In this infographic it was also displayed
              some of the script and quotes that the voice is going to explore.
